# UI Components

22 design components written in HTML and CSS.

Mission objectives
----

You work in a Web Design agency as a Frontend Integrator. The UI Designer provides you 22 images, each representing a high-fidelity mockup of the website's interface component. Your job is to reproduce in HTML and CSS each of these components. Each UI component has been validated by your customer. It's therefore really important that the end-result looks as close as possible to the mockups.
